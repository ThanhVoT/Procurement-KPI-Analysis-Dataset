# Procurement-KPI-Analysis-Dataset

## Project Background 
As new procurement data from 2022 - 2023 are released into the public, I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to extract inights and deliver recommendations for our stakeholders. **Reflecting on the challenges our suppliers face, cost optimization, quality assurance, and supply chain effiency, this analysis will allow us to take a closer look at the data to provide strategic insights to drive decision-making.**

## Executive Summary 
This dataset contains over 700 real-world purchases orders from the year 2022 - 2023 from big companies to **reflect on challenges like supplier delays, compliance gaps, and defects. Ideal for analyzing supply chain efficiency, cost optimization, and vendor performance.** By analyzing this data, we can apply predictive forecasting, optimize price negotiations, and identify the most effective suppliers. There is a noticeable trend where suppliers like **Delta_Logistics** and **Beta_Supplies** not only have the highest percentage of defective units but are also the two most frequently used suppliers out of the five available. Understanding why customers continue to prefer these suppliers—and how we can leverage this insight—could help us identify opportunities to both reduce costs and increase revenue. This data presents valuable information that can drive more informed, strategic decisions.
