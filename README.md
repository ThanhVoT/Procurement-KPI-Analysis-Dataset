# Procurement-KPI-Analysis-Dataset

## Project Background 
As new procurement data from 2022 - 2023 are released into the public, I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to extract inights and deliver recommendations for our stakeholders. **Reflecting on the challenges our suppliers face, cost optimization, quality assurance, and supply chain effiency, this analysis will allow us to take a closer look at the data to provide strategic insights to drive decision-making.**

## Executive Summary 
This dataset contains over 700 real-world purchases orders from the year 2022 - 2023 from big companies to **reflect on challenges like supplier delays, compliance gaps, and defects. Ideal for analyzing supply chain efficiency, cost optimization, and vendor performance.**
